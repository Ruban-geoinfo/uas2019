                <p>Welcome to <strong>ELIPPSS</strong>. This web portal provides visualization and processing tools for data created during the Unmanned Aerial Systems class in spring 2019, held at the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.uni-muenster.de/Geoinformatics/en/">Institute for Geoinformatics</a>                    in the University of Münster. The course was held by <a target="_blank" href="https://www.uni-muenster.de/OekologischePlanung/en/team/lehmann.html">Professor Jan Lehmann</a>,
                    <a target="_blank" href="https://www.uni-muenster.de/IVVgeo/dieivv/mitarbeiter/prinz.html">Professor Torsten Prinz</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://www.uni-muenster.de/Geoinformatics/institute/staff/index.php/55/Sergey_Mukhametov">Professor Sergey Mukhametov</a>.</p>

                    <h1>Renaturating the Aa River</h1>
                    <p class="homeText">In recent decades greater awareness for the sensitivity and the importance of river ecosystems has emerged in trans-national governmental institutions from national to local level. This lead to the initiation of renaturation procedures
                        for rivers under the European Union water policies: EU Water Framework Directive (WFD) with “good quantitative status” and “good chemical status” of all rivers until 2023. <br> <br> Major challenges that rivers and lakes in Europe
                        face are grouped into: water availability and supply challenges, water quality issues, structural changes to and physical modifications of rivers and lakes (EU, 2016). In 2008 the municipal government of Münster authorised the
                        renaturation of the Aa river, which flows through the city. These renaturation measures will help restore a section of the Aa to its natural state. <br> <br> Monitoring and exploratory approaches to assess the effects on vegetation
                        and hydromorphological quality such as river bank structure, river continuity and/ or substrate of the river bed, turned out to be a suitable and assertive opportunity to gain knowledge by using geospatial technologies in a practical
                        context.<br><br> For more information about water body renaturation please visit <a target="_blank" href="http://ec.europa.eu/environment/water/index_en.htm">http://ec.europa.eu/environment/water</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://publications.europa.eu/en/publication-detail/-/publication/4890db5a-ddc9-4181-9d39-8a277faef30b">https://publications.europa.eu</a>.
